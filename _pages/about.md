I am pursuing my PhD. in Computer Science at the University of Minnesota.
I am a Fulbright Scholar. My current research interests include Information and Communications Technology for Development (ICT4D), Human Computer Interaction (HCI), Social Computing, and Machine Learning.

I completed my MS in Applied Data Science from the University of Southern California. I am deeply passionate about examining technology through a multifaceted lens. Recognizing that technology is not accessible for all and its design, implementation, and accessibility can perpetuate or challenge societal norms and biases, I'm particularly drawn to understanding the nuances of how different populations interact with and are affected by technology. By bridging the realms of technology and social sciences, I aim to advocate for and contribute to more inclusive and equitable tech solutions that truly cater to the needs of all users.
