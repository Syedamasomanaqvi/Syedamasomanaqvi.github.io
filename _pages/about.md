I am pursuing my MS in Applied Data Science from the University of Southern California. I am a Fulbright Scholar. My current research interests include Information and Communications Technology for Development (ICT4D) and Human Computer Interaction (HCI), Social Computing and Machine Learning.

I completed my BS in Mathematics and Economics from Lahore University of Management Sciences, Lahore.  Later, I worked as a Research Associate in the Computer Science Department at LUMS under the supervision of Dr. Agha Ali Raza (Ph.D Carnegie Mellon University) and Dr. Maryam Mustafa (MS Cornell University) whose work greatly inspired me. I continue to collaborate with them on projects on the intersection of technology and society.

I am deeply passionate about examining technology through a multifaceted lens. Recognizing that technology is not neutral and that its design, implementation, and accessibility can perpetuate or challenge societal norms and biases, I'm particularly drawn to understanding the nuances of how different populations interact with and are affected by technology. By bridging the realms of technology and social sciences, I aim to advocate for and contribute to more inclusive and equitable tech solutions that truly cater to the needs of all users.
