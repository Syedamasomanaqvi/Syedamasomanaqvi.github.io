I am pursuing my MS in Applied Data Science from the University of Southern California. I am a Fulbright Scholar. My current research interests include Machine Learning, Information and Communications Technology for Development (ICT4D) and Human Computer Interaction (HCI). and understanding human behavior and norms through data.

I completed my BS in Mathematics and Economics from Lahore University of Management Sciences, Lahore.  Later, I worked as a Research Assistant in the Computer Science Department at LUMS under the supervision of Dr. Agha Ali Raza (Carnegie Mellon University) and Dr. Maryam Mustafa (Cornell University) whose work greatly inspired me.  I continue to collaborate with them on projects on the intersection of technology and society.

I like thinking about technology from a social and gendered perspective and understanding human behavior and norms through data.
